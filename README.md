SpeedReader
===========
New services like [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) clame that you are able to read text much faster if you dont have to move
youre eyes around a page. By showing one and one word of max 13 characters at the time, like a stream, the startup says that you are able to read
faster. MUCH faster. 

The average person reads 200 - 300 words per minute in the old way, but, as the startup clames, by streaming one word at the time
you can train yourself to around 500 - 800 words per minute.
